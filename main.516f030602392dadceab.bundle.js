Gangs of humans, and beast folk alike started attacking settlements for their own greedy purposes. Those were the the lucky towns, others were destroyed without mercy, without reason. Then came that one fateful night...</p>\n\n  <p>By your determination to live, or perhaps sheer dumb luck, you survived the chaos that destroyed your home. As a new day dawns a traveler driving a beat up looking military transport passed through what was left of you home. Surprised to see anyone alive he stopped to greet you.</p>\n\n  <p>“Dammit it all! Town after town I come to, each one of them has been reduced to nothing but rubble. The whole damn ‘Waste has gone crazy!” He paused to take a glance around him, noticing other survivors coming out of the rubble. “Yet, you folks are the first survivors I’ve found.  Listen, if you can pull your own weight, you can tag along with me to Haven!”</p>\n\n  <p>“Haven?” you ask.</p>\n\n  <p>“Haven is the last great city in the Central Wastes! Now gather what things your have left. We need to get moving.

The horde had arrived.  You run into the transport telling the driver to floor it. The engine roars to life as the transport begins to speed away, one of you companions gets on the mounted turret to repel any damned \'Coyote that came close. Within minutes you hear the sounds of turret fire disappear. You go to pull her down from the turret, only to find a hole in her chest.  You yell for someone to get on the gun, but your command is drowned out by the noise of the engine sputtering, until it too falls silent. Slowly the transport start to lose speed. In a horrific silence you realize that this was the end. Would you kneel down and wait for death, or would you die fighting?

After several days of traveling you reached the first milestone of your journey. The Edge. </p>\n    <p>\n      This was the last major settlement on this side of the waste. Surrounding the settlement were camps of the various natives to this world. Owl creatures known as the Okins, their wings clipped to the bones marking them as exiles.  Lizard-Folk with scales of oranges and browns towering over even the tallest humans. Cat-folk sitting around watching all the goings on with intense curiosity. Oddly enough there small enclave From the Alpine Den, a race humanoid wolves who have been using crystals to power their lives long before humans began to take "inspiration" from them.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In the center of the town was a giant marketplace the likes you have never seen before. A scene of organised chaos, the sights and sounds of everyone moving through the streets, merchants and food stalls peddling their wares. All under the watchful sensors of the small group of androids tasked with keeping the peace. You take as much of it in as you can, knowing that after leaving The Edge, it will be nothing but the arid expanse of sand, rocks, and nothingness until you reach Haven.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div *ngIf="this.playerService.getPlayer().lastMonument === 2">\n    <h1>The Refuge</h1>\n    <p>The second stretch of the journey through the treacherous uncaring terrain seemed drag on much longer than it had.  The dreams of living in an actual dwelling and not some souped up transport are constantly popping in and out of your head.  Off in the distance is a large mountain with many smaller peaks comes into view.  The driver tells you that this the next stop in your journey.  It was remarkable that the driver was even able to navigate the bulky transport up the mountain path, but he did it.  When you finally step outside to see your surroundings your are taken aback.</p>\n    <p>\n      It seemed impossible, but here was a massive lake of clean water, and vegetation lining the walls provided by the mountain peaks.  Even back in the settled regions of the Central Wastes, the water was not as clean as this! You spend the rest of the day by the lake, swimming and lounging around without a care in the world.  Throughout the day other travelers come and go, a reminder that you too will leave this lake far behind and continue on your journey.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div *ngIf="this.playerService.getPlayer().lastMonument === 3">\n    <h1>The Crater</h1>\n    <p>A few hundred miles inland from the Western Ocean is an awe inspiring mountain range, that stretches from southern most part of the Central Waste, to the northern most point. Even a hundred miles out you can see the northernmost peak as it reflects the light that shines upon it.  After the arduous travel from peaceful scenery of the Refuge, you arrive at what is left of the northern part of the range.  The Crater.</p>\n    <p>\n   You walk up to the edge of the crater, and as far the eye can see the it swallows up everything including a chunk of the mountain range. Looking to the sloping sides of the crater, you can make out rocks, and debris.  Even the center of the crater is too far away to make out, but if you squint hard enough, it looked like a space faring ship had crash long ago. Something truly horrific was said to have happened centuries long before humans set foot on this world.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You step away from the edge and slowly gaze up from the depths of the crater to where the mountain range begins.  As the mountain rises up from the crater you can see the glass scars that cover the mountain reflecting the light of the sun. You think back to the Refuge reminding you there can be great beauty in this life, but as you stare into the depth of the crater you are brutally reminded there is the capacity for utter destruction. Not dissimilar to the fate the befell your ancestors homeworld: Earth.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div *ngIf="this.playerService.getPlayer().lastMonument === 4">\n    <h1>The Towers</h1>\n    <p> After traveling along the great mountain range separating you from your destination. You reach the tail end of the mountain range on the southern edge of the Central Waste.  However, the untamed peaks quickly give way to a multitude of stone towers. The inhabitants of these have not used these towers in a long time, as their once intricate decorations have been dulled by the wind and sand. You watch as one of the towers in nearby finally crumbles into oblivion below. </p>\n    <p>\n      As you pass through the towers, you meet a small group of explorers who have set up a permanent camp in the center of the towers.  Around the comfort of a campfire, an old Lizard-folk hobbles into the fire light from his seat. "When my great ancestors were young, it was said there was a civilization that lived above it all, at the tops of these towers.  Even back then no one knew what they truly looked like, for them kept themselves wrapped in layers of leather, and cloth. They didn\'t even have wings! Yet upon these towers they lived and died. On great ships the hung in the sky, as a bird hangs on a branch. Then one day, they vanished. Their great ships soon fell from the skies, still there was no trace that anyone had been aboard. Today their towers still stand, until they too crumble."\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As you pass through the last bit of the ancient dead city, you can\'t help but to wonder what this place was really like. Soon your mind is preoccupied with something else. Haven is only two-hundred miles away! The journey is almost over!\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n  <p><strong>Please select a stat to increase.

The goal of the game is to reach Haven safely, before a horde of humanoid coyotes with a penchant for violence, and unquenchable bloodlust catches up to you.
